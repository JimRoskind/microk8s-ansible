- name Attempt to install microk8s.
#  Command will sometimes fail due to timeout, as snap takes a while.
#  The good news is that it typically makes incremental progress, and will
#  eventually succeed.  I should figure out how to adjust the timeout
#  for the running of the underlying shell command.
#  When this command completes, the nodes will be running "singleton"
#  kubernetes clusters, and must still be "joined" together into a
#  larger cluster.
